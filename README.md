# Algorithms and Data Structures
## List 1 (C++)
Implementation of some data structures:
1. queue and stack
2. singly linked list
3. circular doubly linked list<br>

Implemented merge functions and measuring time accessing elements on different positions in lists.

## List 2 (C++)
Implementation of chosen sorting algorithms:
Usage:
```
./chosen_generator sizeOfArrayToSort | ./chosen_sort
```
or to get statistics (total number of swaps and comparisions for different array size written to a file):
```
./chosen_sort -s
```
